    <div
    
      <p>You might be surprised to learn that there are around 20 varieties of cherry tree in Japan, ranging in appearance, size, colour and timing of their bloom. These are some of the most common and popular:</p>

      <p>‘Somei Yoshino’ (Yoshino Cherry Blossom)</p>
      <img src="Images/somei-yoshino-cherry-blossom-4.jpg">
    
     <p>Considered the most classic cherry blossom, the ‘somei yoshino’ variety is the most common tree you’ll encounter in Japan. Cultivated for its beauty during the Edo Period (1603-1868), the somei yoshino is a small flower of five petals with a slightly pink hue. The trees are stunning in full bloom as their leaves do not bud until after the flowers reach their peak, creating the truly beautiful sight of trees heavy with a full white/pink canopy.</p>

    <div>

      <p>‘Yamazakura’ (Mountain Cherry Blossom)</p>
      <img src="Images/yamazakura-cherry-blossom-4.jpg">

      <p>‘Yamazakura’ or ‘Mountain Blossm’ trees also produce fragile white/pink flowers with five petals but unlike somei yoshino blossoms, the yamazakura occurs wild and was not cultivated. While the flowers look quite similar, yamazakura produce leaves at the same time that they flower making the full bloom less intense than somei yoshino tree and easy to distinguish.</p>

    <div>

    <p>‘Yaezakura’ (Double Cherry Blossom)</p>
    <img src="Images/yaezakura-cherry-blossom-1.jpg">

    <p>Translating as ‘double cherry blossom’ ‘yaezakura’ have anything from 10 to 50 petals per flower and occur in a wide variety of colours – from vibrant pink to deep red through to pure white. While individual petals are also fragile, the increased number in each flower gives yaezakura a more robust appearance and ability to stay on the tree longer.</p>

<div>

  <p>‘Shidarezakura’ (Weeping Cherry Blossom)</p>
  <img src="Images/shidarezakura-cherry-blossom-5.jpg">

  <p>Named for their thin drooping branches that fall to the ground like a willow tree, ‘shidarezakura’ come in two varieties that bloom around one week apart. The trees are much-loved in Japan and often depicted or referenced in traditional art and poetry. Of the two types, one is related to the somei yoshino – producing 5-petaled flowers – while the other is related to the yaezakura – producing more robust flowers – with both varieties existing in a range of colours.</p>

<div>

  <p>‘Gyoikozakura’ (Imperial Yellow Cherry Blossoms)<p>
    <img src="Images/gyoikozakura-cherry-blossom-2.jpg">

  <p>Many people will miss the uniquely beautiful sight of ‘gyoiko’ blossoms due to their large and uniquely coloured flowers that change as they bloom. Starting with yellow petals the flowers turn green as they mature. Even many Japanese are not familiar with this variety of cherry tree or may not realise they are a variety of sakura making them a rare treat to spot and photograph.<p>
